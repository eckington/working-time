** TODO Make main menu
   SCHEDULED: <2019-11-10>
   There's no point making the game to a good standard if there's no
   effort put into creating a main menu for it.

   (this is complete now, just need to make charsel)

*** TODO Create character selection tool
    This needs to be made so that we meet the criteria for character
    choices.

** TODO Allow user to pick difficulty
   Perhaps this would affect the speed at which the cars move, or the
   rate at which they respawn.
